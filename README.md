# HDLBits Verilog Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from [HDLBits]([https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page)), a platform for practicing digital logic design using Verilog HDL.

Iâ€™m using this space to improve my understanding of:
- Combinational and sequential logic
- Register-transfer-level (RTL) design principles
- Basic Verilog syntax and modeling techniques

Structure:
Solutions are organized based on HDLBits problem categories.

Note:  
These solutions are part of my learning journey and may be improved over time as I progress further into Verilog and digital system design.
